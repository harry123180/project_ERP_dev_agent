## Session Date: September 12, 2025

---

## 📋 Session Overview

**Work Period**: September 12, 2025, 09:50:21 (Taiwan Standard Time)
**Duration**: Full development session
**Main Objectives**: Complete ERP system enhancements and optimization tasks
**Systems Worked On**: 
- ERP Procurement System
- Inventory Management System
- Delivery Management System
- Questions & Notifications System

---

## 🎯 Major Tasks Completed

### 1. **Delivery Management System Enhancement** ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Fix field mapping issues and improve status synchronization between frontend and backend

#### Key Issues Resolved:
- **Field Name Mismatch**: Backend used `purchase_order_no` but frontend expected `po_number`
- **Status Logic Separation**: Fixed confusion between "交貨狀態" and "物流狀態" columns
- **Dynamic Updates**: Ensured real-time status synchronization across UI components

#### Technical Implementation:
- Updated backend API response mapping for dual field compatibility
- Separated delivery status logic in frontend components
- Implemented proper status cascading from updates to display

### 2. **Questions Overview System Improvements** ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Transform from requisition-level to item-level tracking with enhanced LINE messaging

#### Key Enhancements:
- **Statistical Focus Shift**: Changed from counting requisitions to counting individual items
- **LINE Message Enhancement**: Improved from generic codes to descriptive, actionable messages
- **Information Hierarchy**: Made item names primary, requisition numbers secondary

#### Impact:
- More accurate workload representation
- Clearer communication through LINE notifications
- Improved user experience with actionable information
