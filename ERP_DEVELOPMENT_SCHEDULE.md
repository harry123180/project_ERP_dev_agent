## Dependencies & Risk Analysis

### Critical Path Dependencies:
1. **Sprint 1 → Sprint 2:** Database fixes must complete before new modules
2. **Sprint 2 P1-01/P1-02 → Sprint 2 P1-03:** Backend APIs must exist before frontend integration
3. **Sprint 2 → Sprint 3:** Core functionality must be stable before performance optimization

### High-Risk Items:
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Database migration complexity | MEDIUM | HIGH | Dedicated DBA support, rollback plan |
| Performance optimization scope creep | HIGH | MEDIUM | Strict acceptance criteria, time-boxing |
| Frontend-backend integration issues | MEDIUM | HIGH | Daily integration testing, pair programming |
| Third-party service dependencies (Redis) | LOW | MEDIUM | Local development setup, fallback caching |
