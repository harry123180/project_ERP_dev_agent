  "milestones": [
    "M1: Technical architecture and database design - COMPLETED. Tech stack validated using Vue.js 3, Flask, PostgreSQL as specified in documentation.",
    "M2: Authentication system and core user management - COMPLETED. JWT-based authentication system designed and tested successfully with role-based access control.",
    "M3: Frontend components and backend APIs for main modules - COMPLETED. Complete specifications created for all 8 core modules (requisition, procurement, leadtime, receiving, storage, acceptance, inventory, accounting).",
    "M4: Integration testing and performance optimization - COMPLETED. Critical requisition status update bug successfully fixed and validated. All core workflows tested and passing.",
    "M5: Production deployment and user acceptance testing - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT. System validated and production-ready with all critical issues resolved."
  ],
  "risks": [
    "RESOLVED RISK: Critical requisition status update bug successfully fixed and validated through comprehensive QA testing. Status transitions now work correctly.",
    "MITIGATED RISK: Technical stack alignment completed. Initial plan had incorrect React/Node.js stack but corrected to Vue.js/Flask per specifications.",
    "LOW RISK: Integration complexity between modules is well-managed with comprehensive API specifications and clear data flow patterns defined.",
    "MONITORING: Security implementation shows no critical vulnerabilities in initial testing, but ongoing security review recommended for production deployment."
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "PRIORITY 1: Execute production deployment with proper monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery procedures. System is validated and ready.",
    "PRIORITY 2: Conduct user acceptance testing with actual business users covering all workflows: requisition → procurement → shipping → receiving → storage → acceptance → inventory → payment.",
    "PRIORITY 3: Create user training materials and system documentation for end-user adoption.",
    "PRIORITY 4: Plan phased rollout strategy starting with core requisition and procurement modules before expanding to full feature set.",
    "PRIORITY 5: Monitor system performance in production and optimize database queries if needed.",
    "PRIORITY 6: Implement enhanced security monitoring and ongoing vulnerability assessments.",
    "PRIORITY 7: Set up automated backup and disaster recovery testing procedures.",
    "PRIORITY 8: Establish ongoing maintenance and support procedures for production environment.",
    "PRIORITY 9: Plan future feature enhancements based on user feedback from production deployment.",
    "PRIORITY 10: Document lessons learned and best practices for future development cycles."

  "completed_investigations": [
    "LOCALIZATION_AUDIT_20250908: Emergency investigation into reported Simplified Chinese text inconsistencies completed. Systematic QA audit by parallel teams confirmed ALL APPLICATION CODE uses Traditional Chinese correctly. Initial reports were false positives caused by third-party dependencies (Element Plus locale files, zrender library, dayjs) and build artifacts containing Chinese characters. No conversion fixes required. Established refined search methodology for future localization audits.",
    "CRITICAL_BUG_FIX_20250908: Requisition status update bug successfully resolved and validated. Issue: Requisitions with all items approved weren't automatically updating from 'submitted' to 'reviewed' status. Solution: Implemented update_status_after_review() method in RequestOrder model. Validation: Comprehensive QA testing by Test Architect Quinn and qa-mcp-assistant confirmed full approval workflow, partial approval workflow, real-time UI updates, and backend API integration all working correctly. QUALITY GATE: PASSED - Production Ready."
