  "summary": "Comprehensive test execution of ERP system covering 18 test cases across authentication, procurement workflow, inventory management, role-based access control, API endpoints, performance, UI responsiveness, integration, and error handling. Out of 18 test cases executed: 15 passed, 2 failed, 1 blocked. Key findings: Authentication and core procurement workflows function correctly with proper role-based restrictions. Performance issues detected with large datasets requiring optimization. API endpoints follow proper REST conventions. Integration workflow completes successfully end-to-end. Two critical issues identified: PERF_001 failed due to page load times exceeding 2-second threshold, and ERROR_001 failed due to insufficient error recovery mechanisms during network interruptions.",
