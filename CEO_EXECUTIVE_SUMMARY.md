# üìä CEO EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CRITICAL BUG FIX PROJECT

**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Subject**: ERP Requisition Status Update Bug - Project Plan & Resolution Strategy  
**Prepared by**: John, Product Manager  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - CEO Visibility  

---

## The Problem

**Critical Issue**: Requisition status is NOT updating from "Â∑≤Êèê‰∫§" (submitted) to "Â∑≤ÂØ©Ê†∏" (reviewed) after all items are approved through the system UI.

**Business Impact**:
- Management cannot see approval status accurately
- Procurement workflow appears broken to stakeholders
- Financial visibility compromised
- Executive decision-making hindered

---

## Root Cause Analysis

Through comprehensive system analysis, I've identified the core issue:

**Frontend state synchronization problem**: The UI emits update events after approvals but doesn't properly validate that the backend status has actually changed before displaying the updated status to users.

**Technical Details**:
- Backend correctly updates status in database
- API endpoints properly process approvals
- Frontend shows cached status data instead of fresh data
- Timing issue between UI updates and database commits

---

## Solution Strategy

### 1. Immediate Fix (4-6 hours)
- **Frontend State Synchronization**: Fix event handling and store management
- **Backend Robustness**: Enhanced logging and API responses  
- **Status Polling**: Implement retry mechanism for status updates

### 2. Validation Framework (4-5 hours)  
- **Playwright MCP Testing**: Automated UI validation through real browser interaction
- **Cross-browser Verification**: Ensure fix works across all platforms
- **Performance Validation**: Status updates within 2-second requirement

### 3. Quality Assurance (3-4 hours)
- **Business Process Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensure no existing functionality broken
- **Sign-off Protocol**: Formal QA approval for production deployment
