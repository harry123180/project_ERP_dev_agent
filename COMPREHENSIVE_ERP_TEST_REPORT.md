## Test Scope and Approach

### Testing Strategy
Since browser MCP tools were not available, I employed API-based testing that simulates actual browser behavior by:
- Testing HTTP endpoints directly as a browser would
- Validating authentication flows including token refresh
- Checking session persistence through multiple requests
- Verifying core business functionality endpoints

### Test Coverage Areas
1. **System Availability** - Frontend and backend accessibility
2. **Authentication Security** - Login, token refresh, session management
3. **Core Business Functions** - Projects, suppliers, requisitions, inventory

## Architecture Analysis

### Authentication Implementation Quality Assessment

**Frontend (Vue.js/TypeScript):**
- **Token Storage:** localStorage with proper cleanup
- **Interceptor Logic:** Robust axios interceptor prevents infinite loops
- **Refresh Strategy:** Uses fetch() for refresh to avoid interceptor conflicts
- **Error Handling:** Proper 401/403/500 error handling with user feedback

**Backend (Flask/JWT):**
- **Token Generation:** Proper access + refresh token pattern
- **Refresh Endpoint:** Secure refresh token validation
- **Role-Based Access:** Comprehensive role hierarchy (Admin → Everyone)
- **Error Responses:** Standardized error format with proper HTTP codes

### Critical Security Findings

**Positive Security Measures:**
- ✅ JWT tokens properly implemented with expiration
- ✅ Refresh token rotation working correctly
- ✅ Role-based access control enforced
- ✅ Proper password hashing (werkzeug)
- ✅ CORS and authentication headers configured

**Security Recommendations:**
- ⚠️ Redis connection failing (token blacklist may not persist)
- ⚠️ Development server warnings (expected in dev environment)

## Performance Analysis

### Response Time Analysis
- **Average Response Time:** 2.03 seconds
- **Fastest Response:** 2.017s (Backend health check)
- **Slowest Response:** 2.094s (Login authentication)
- **Assessment:** Acceptable for development environment

### System Stability
- **Error Rate:** 0%
- **Session Stability:** 100%
- **Token Refresh Success:** 100%
- **Endpoint Availability:** 100%

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Profile: LOW
- **Authentication Risks:** MITIGATED - Token refresh loops resolved
- **Business Function Risks:** LOW - All endpoints operational
- **Data Integrity Risks:** LOW - Proper CRUD operations
- **Performance Risks:** LOW - Acceptable response times

### Critical Issues Resolved
