## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks
- **Database Changes**: All schema modifications tested with production data copies
- **Authentication Changes**: Maintain fallback authentication during transition
- **API Modifications**: Use API versioning to support rollback
- **Performance Changes**: Continuous monitoring with rollback triggers

### Business Risks
- **System Downtime**: All changes deployed during maintenance windows
- **Data Loss**: Comprehensive backup strategy before any data migrations
- **User Impact**: Feature flags allow gradual rollout of changes
- **Timeline Delays**: Phases can be adjusted based on business priorities

### Organizational Risks
- **Knowledge Transfer**: All changes documented with team knowledge sharing
- **Resource Allocation**: Stories sized for available team capacity
- **Change Management**: Regular stakeholder communication and feedback
