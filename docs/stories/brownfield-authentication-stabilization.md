# Story: Authentication System Stabilization

<!-- Source: Brownfield PRD + Integration Architecture + Epic Analysis -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to existing ERP system with critical 401 errors -->

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a **system administrator** and **end user**,
I want the authentication system to work consistently without 401 errors,
so that users can access the ERP system reliably without being randomly logged out or encountering API failures.

## Context Source

- **Source Document**: docs/brownfield-prd.md (REQ-BF-001), docs/integration-architecture.md
- **Enhancement Type**: Critical bug fix with system stabilization
- **Existing System Impact**: High - affects all users and all API endpoints
- **Current State**: MVP with critical authentication failures causing 401 errors
- **Priority**: P0 (Blocking production deployment)

## Current System Analysis

### Known Authentication Issues (Critical P0)
1. **Axios interceptor not properly adding Authorization headers**
   - Located in `frontend/src/api/index.ts`
   - Token present in localStorage but not consistently attached to requests
   
2. **Pinia store initialization issues**  
   - Session management fails on page refresh
   - Multiple authentication paths causing conflicts

3. **Router navigation errors after login**
   - Users redirected incorrectly after authentication
   - Session state not properly restored

### Technical Context
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with Element Plus UI library
- **Backend**: Flask with JWT using Flask-JWT-Extended
- **Current Auth Flow**: JWT with refresh token mechanism (has bugs)
- **Storage**: localStorage for token persistence
- **API Base**: `/api/v1` with Bearer token authentication

## Acceptance Criteria

### Authentication Stability
- [ ] **AC1**: All API calls include proper Authorization headers consistently
- [ ] **AC2**: Token refresh works seamlessly without user disruption
- [ ] **AC3**: No 401 errors during normal operation (except invalid credentials)
- [ ] **AC4**: Session persists across page refreshes without re-login
- [ ] **AC5**: Login/logout flow works reliably without navigation errors

### System Compatibility  
- [ ] **AC6**: Existing API endpoints continue to work unchanged
- [ ] **AC7**: All existing user roles and permissions remain intact
- [ ] **AC8**: No regression in requisition, procurement, or inventory modules
- [ ] **AC9**: WebSocket connections maintain authentication state
- [ ] **AC10**: Performance remains within acceptable bounds (<500ms API response)

### Error Handling
- [ ] **AC11**: Clear error messages for authentication failures
- [ ] **AC12**: Graceful degradation when refresh token expires
- [ ] **AC13**: Automatic redirect to login when session truly expires
- [ ] **AC14**: Proper cleanup of expired tokens from localStorage

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

**Current File Locations:**
- Frontend API client: `frontend/src/api/index.ts` (needs fixing)
- Auth store: `frontend/src/stores/auth.ts` (assumed location)
- Backend auth: `backend/app.py` and related auth modules
- JWT configuration: Backend Flask-JWT-Extended setup

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- API versioning: `/api/v1/` prefix
- JWT Bearer token format: `Bearer {token}`
- Element Plus UI components for messaging
- localStorage for token persistence

### Integration Approach

**Primary Fix Areas:**
1. **Axios Interceptor Enhancement** (frontend/src/api/index.ts):
   ```javascript
   // Fix the existing interceptor at line 14-28
   // Ensure token is consistently added to ALL requests
   // Improve error handling and retry logic
   ```

2. **Token Refresh Flow** (frontend/src/api/index.ts line 35-50):
   ```javascript
   // Fix the existing refresh mechanism
   // Prevent infinite loops on refresh failures
   // Handle concurrent request scenarios
   ```

3. **Session State Management**:
   - Ensure Pinia store properly initializes from localStorage
   - Handle page refresh scenario without state loss
   - Coordinate between router and authentication state

### Technical Constraints

- **Backward Compatibility**: Cannot change existing API contract
- **Performance**: Authentication checks must not add >50ms overhead
- **Concurrent Requests**: Handle multiple simultaneous API calls during token refresh
- **Error Boundaries**: Must not break existing error handling patterns

### Integration Points

**Critical Integration Points:**
- All existing API modules (requisition, procurement, inventory, etc.)
- Vue Router navigation guards
- WebSocket authentication (if implemented)
- Background processes and periodic API calls

**Files Likely to Need Updates:**
- `frontend/src/api/index.ts` (primary fix location)
- `frontend/src/stores/auth.ts` (session management)
- `frontend/src/router/index.ts` (navigation guards)
- Backend auth endpoints (error response standardization)

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

- **Primary Risk**: Authentication changes could break existing login flow or cause widespread 401 errors
- **Secondary Risk**: Token refresh logic could create race conditions with concurrent API calls
- **Performance Risk**: Additional auth logic could slow down API calls

### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Phased Testing**:
   - Test auth flow in isolation first
   - Verify existing API endpoints work unchanged
   - Test concurrent request scenarios

2. **Feature Flag Approach**:
   - Implement new auth logic behind feature flag if possible
   - Allow quick rollback to existing behavior

3. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Test all user roles and permission levels
   - Test page refresh scenarios
   - Test token expiration and refresh scenarios

### Rollback Plan

- **Step 1**: Revert `frontend/src/api/index.ts` to current version
- **Step 2**: Clear all localStorage auth tokens to force clean login
- **Step 3**: Restart frontend and backend services if needed
- **Verification**: Confirm login works with basic functionality

### Safety Checks

- [ ] **Pre-Implementation**: Document current auth behavior with screenshots
- [ ] **During Implementation**: Keep backup of working auth files
- [ ] **Post-Implementation**: Verify all existing features work unchanged
- [ ] **Rollback Ready**: Test rollback procedure before deployment

- Session persistence across page refreshes
- Successful token refresh without user interruption

### Technical Success  
- All existing API endpoints maintain current response times
- No regression in existing functionality
- Clean error handling and user feedback
- Stable authentication flow under load

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Zero 401 errors in normal operation
- [ ] All existing features verified working
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested and documented
- [ ] Code reviewed for security best practices
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed by stakeholders

## Notes

**Critical Success Factor**: This fix must maintain 100% backward compatibility while solving the authentication stability issues. The system is currently in production with users, so any authentication changes must be thoroughly tested and reversible.

**Developer Priority**: Focus on the existing auth flow rather than rewriting. The current structure is mostly correct but has timing/state management bugs that need targeted fixes.

**Testing Priority**: Authentication affects every part of the system, so comprehensive regression testing is essential.
