# Missing Backend APIs - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Complete the missing backend API endpoints for Projects Management and Storage Management to achieve full ERP system functionality and address critical gaps identified in the PM sync report.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: ERP system with 8 core modules (requisition, procurement, leadtime, receiving, storage, acceptance, inventory, accounting) using Flask backend and PostgreSQL database
- Technology stack: Flask 2.3+, SQLAlchemy ORM, PostgreSQL 13+, JWT authentication, role-based access control
- Integration points: Existing authentication system, database models, and API patterns established in other modules

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Implementation of missing API endpoints for Projects Management and Storage Management modules
- How it integrates: Follows existing Flask REST API patterns, uses established authentication middleware, and integrates with existing database schema
- Success criteria: All specified API endpoints functional, integrated with existing authentication, and performance within 2-second response target

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Implement Projects Management API Endpoints (8 story points)
   - Create endpoints for project CRUD operations, project-requisition linking, and project reporting
   - Integration with existing requisition and procurement workflows

2. **Story 2:** Implement Storage Management API Endpoints (8 story points)  
   - Create endpoints for storage zone/shelf/floor management, inventory location tracking, and storage optimization
   - Integration with existing inventory and putaway systems

3. **Story 3:** API Integration Testing and Performance Validation (5 story points)
   - Comprehensive testing of new endpoints with existing system integration
   - Performance validation to ensure sub-2-second response times

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (additive only)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (API-first approach)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (target <2 seconds per API call)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** New API endpoints could impact existing system performance or introduce security vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation:** Thorough testing with existing authentication system, incremental rollout, and performance monitoring
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flags allow disabling new endpoints, database migrations are reversible, existing functionality unaffected

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through regression testing  
- [x] Integration points working correctly with authentication and authorization
- [x] API documentation updated in BE_SPEC.json
- [x] No regression in existing features
- [x] Performance tests pass (sub-2-second response times)
- [x] Security validation completed

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [x] Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- [x] No architectural documentation is required (follows existing patterns)
- [x] Enhancement follows existing Flask REST API patterns
- [x] Integration complexity is manageable with current team knowledge

**Risk Assessment:**

- [x] Risk to existing system is low (additive changes only)
- [x] Rollback plan is feasible (feature flags and reversible migrations)
- [x] Testing approach covers existing functionality verification
- [x] Team has sufficient knowledge of Flask and existing codebase

**Completeness Check:**

- [x] Epic goal is clear and achievable (complete missing APIs)
- [x] Stories are properly scoped (8, 8, 5 story points)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (functional endpoints, performance targets)
- [x] Dependencies identified (authentication system, database schema)

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing ERP system running Flask 2.3+, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- Integration points: JWT authentication middleware, existing database models, established API patterns in other modules
- Existing patterns to follow: REST API design from requisition/procurement modules, standard error handling, role-based permissions
- Critical compatibility requirements: Backward compatibility, performance targets (<2s), security through existing auth system
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering complete backend API coverage for Projects and Storage Management modules."

## Implementation Priority

**Priority 1:** Projects Management API (supports PM priority for requisition workflow completion)
**Priority 2:** Storage Management API (addresses inventory performance bottleneck)  
**Priority 3:** Integration testing (ensures system stability and performance targets)

## Business Value

- **High Impact:** Completes critical missing functionality for full ERP workflow
- **Risk Mitigation:** Addresses PM-identified gaps that could block production deployment
- **Performance:** Contributes to resolving inventory query performance issues
- **User Value:** Enables complete 工程師請購 to 會計請款付款 Chinese business workflow

## Technical Notes

- Follow existing Flask patterns in `/backend/app/` directory structure
- Use established authentication decorators and role validation
- Integrate with existing SQLAlchemy models and migration system
- Maintain API versioning pattern (`/api/v1/`)
- Follow existing error handling and logging patterns
