# üö® CRITICAL BUG FIX PROJECT PLAN - ERP REQUISITION STATUS UPDATE

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL BUG**: Requisition status NOT updating from "Â∑≤Êèê‰∫§" (submitted) to "Â∑≤ÂØ©Ê†∏" (reviewed) after all items are approved through the UI.

**SEVERITY**: CRITICAL - CEO is watching, CANNOT FAIL
**TIMELINE**: IMMEDIATE - Must be resolved within 24 hours
**IMPACT**: Business process broken, approvals not reflecting in system

---

## Root Cause Analysis Framework

### Primary Issue Identified
Based on comprehensive codebase analysis, I've identified the core problem:

**The frontend UI emits an 'updated' event after item approval, but this event only triggers a local UI refresh without fetching the latest requisition status from the backend API.**

### Technical Root Causes

1. **Frontend State Synchronization Issue**:
   - In `frontend/src/views/requisitions/Review.vue`, lines 288-291 and 462-465 emit 'updated' events after item approvals
   - However, the parent component (`List.vue`) only closes the dialog and refetches the list without ensuring the status has been updated on the backend
   - The UI shows old cached status data

2. **Backend Transaction Timing**:
   - Backend properly updates status in `backend/app/models/request_order.py` lines 97-108 in `update_status_after_review()`
   - API endpoints flush and commit correctly (lines 332-346 in requisitions.py)
   - BUT there may be a timing issue where the frontend requests status before backend commit is complete

3. **Store State Management Gap**:
   - `frontend/src/stores/requisition.ts` lines 154-171 refresh requisition after approval
   - But `fetchRequisitionDetail()` might be called before database transaction completes

## Development Tasks with Specific Code Areas

### Task 1: Fix Frontend State Synchronization (DEV TEAM)
**Priority: CRITICAL**
**Estimated Time: 2-3 hours**

#### 1.1 Fix Review Component Event Handling
- **File**: `frontend/src/views/requisitions/Review.vue`
- **Lines**: 288-291, 462-465
- **Action**: Ensure 'updated' event includes forced refresh flag
- **Verification**: Status updates immediately after approval

#### 1.2 Fix Store State Management
- **File**: `frontend/src/stores/requisition.ts`
- **Lines**: 154-171
- **Action**: Add retry mechanism and polling for status changes
- **Verification**: Store correctly reflects backend status

#### 1.3 Fix List Component Refresh Logic
- **File**: `frontend/src/views/requisitions/List.vue`
- **Lines**: 271-275
- **Action**: Add status validation after update
- **Verification**: List shows correct status immediately

### Task 2: Backend Robustness Enhancement (DEV TEAM)
**Priority: HIGH**
**Estimated Time: 1-2 hours**

#### 2.1 Add Status Update Logging
- **File**: `backend/app/models/request_order.py`
- **Lines**: 78-108
- **Action**: Enhanced logging for status transitions
- **Verification**: Clear audit trail of status changes

#### 2.2 API Response Enhancement
- **File**: `backend/app/routes/requisitions.py`
- **Lines**: 327-357
- **Action**: Return updated requisition status in approval response
- **Verification**: Frontend gets latest status in API response

## Testing Strategy with Playwright MCP Validation

### Phase 1: Automated UI Testing (QA ASSISTANT)
**Priority: CRITICAL**
**Estimated Time: 2-3 hours**

#### Test Scenario 1: Single Item Approval
1. Navigate to requisitions list
2. Find requisition with status "Â∑≤Êèê‰∫§"
3. Open requisition for review
4. Approve single item with supplier and price
5. Verify status changes to "Â∑≤ÂØ©Ê†∏" in UI
6. Close review dialog
7. Verify status shows "Â∑≤ÂØ©Ê†∏" in list
8. Refresh page and verify status persists

#### Test Scenario 2: Multi-Item Batch Approval
1. Open requisition with multiple items
2. Select all items
3. Use batch approval functionality
4. Verify all items show "approved" status
5. Verify requisition status changes to "Â∑≤ÂØ©Ê†∏"
6. Navigate back to list and verify status

#### Test Scenario 3: Mixed Actions Status Update
1. Open requisition with 3+ items
2. Approve 2 items
3. Reject 1 item
4. Question remaining items
5. Verify status updates to "Â∑≤ÂØ©Ê†∏" when all items processed

### Phase 2: API Integration Testing (QA TEAM)
**Priority: HIGH**
**Estimated Time: 1-2 hours**

#### API Test Cases:
1. Direct API calls to approve items
2. Verify database status updates
3. Test concurrent approval scenarios
4. Validate status consistency across API endpoints

## Success Criteria and Acceptance Testing

### Primary Success Metrics

1. **Functional Requirement**: 
   - ‚úÖ Status MUST change from "Â∑≤Êèê‰∫§" to "Â∑≤ÂØ©Ê†∏" when last item approved
   - ‚úÖ Change must be visible immediately in UI (no refresh required)
   - ‚úÖ Change must persist after page refresh
   - ‚úÖ Must work through UI interaction (no API cheating)

2. **Performance Requirement**:
   - ‚úÖ Status update must complete within 2 seconds of approval
   - ‚úÖ UI must reflect change within 1 second

3. **Reliability Requirement**:
   - ‚úÖ Must work 100% of the time across different browsers
   - ‚úÖ Must work with concurrent users
   - ‚úÖ Must handle network delays gracefully

### Acceptance Testing Framework

#### Browser Compatibility Testing:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest) 
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (Chrome Mobile, Safari Mobile)

#### User Scenario Testing:
- Single approver workflow
- Multiple approvers working simultaneously
- Network interruption scenarios
- Large requisitions (50+ items)
