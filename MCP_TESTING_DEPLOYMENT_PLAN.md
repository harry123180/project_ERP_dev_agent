## 📋 PHASE 1: COMPREHENSIVE MCP TESTING STRATEGY

### **1.1 Complete Workflow Testing**
Target the critical **請購-採購-庫存-會計** (Requisition-Procurement-Inventory-Accounting) end-to-end workflow:

#### **Test Sequence A: Core Business Flow**
```
1. Requisition Creation (請購管理)
   → Login as Engineer role (engineer/eng123)
   → Navigate to requisition creation
   → Create new requisition with multiple items
   → Submit for approval
   → Verify status transitions

2. Procurement Approval (採購管理)  
   → Login as Procurement role (procurement/proc123)
   → Access pending requisitions
   → Review and approve/reject items
   → Assign suppliers and pricing
   → Generate purchase orders

3. Inventory Management (庫存管理)
   → Track incoming shipments
   → Process receiving confirmations
   → Assign storage locations
   → Validate inventory updates

4. Accounting Integration (會計管理)
   → Generate billing batches
   → Process payments
   → Verify financial calculations
   → Complete payment workflow
```

### **1.2 UI Component Validation**
Focus on components that failed in previous API testing:

#### **High Priority Testing Areas**
- **StatusTag.vue**: Previously had export errors - verify UI rendering
- **Requisition Forms**: Input validation and submission
- **Supplier Selection**: Dropdown functionality and data loading
- **Storage Assignment**: Location hierarchy (Zone->Shelf->Floor)
- **Financial Calculations**: Real-time calculation updates

### **1.3 Browser Automation Advantages**
Unlike API testing, MCP browser automation will validate:
- ✅ **Visual UI Rendering**: Actual component display and styling
- ✅ **User Interactions**: Click, form submission, navigation flows  
- ✅ **JavaScript Execution**: Client-side logic and state management
- ✅ **Real User Paths**: Complete user journey simulation
- ✅ **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Testing across different browsers

## 🤖 PHASE 2: QA ASSISTANT MCP INTEGRATION

### **2.1 Custom QA Assistant Deployment**
Leverage our specialized QA Assistant with MCP capabilities:

#### **Testing Automation Framework**
```javascript
// MCP Browser Testing Capabilities
- Real browser instance control
- Element interaction and validation  
- Screenshot capture for evidence
- Network request monitoring
- Console error detection
- Performance measurement
```

#### **Test Evidence Collection**
- **Screenshots**: Capture key workflow states
- **Performance Metrics**: Page load times and response speeds
- **Error Logs**: Console errors and network failures
- **User Journey Documentation**: Step-by-step interaction records

### **2.2 Systematic Validation Approach**

#### **Test Coverage Matrix**
| Module | API Testing Status | MCP Browser Testing Required |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Authentication | ✅ Pass | ✅ UI login flow validation |
| User Management | ✅ Pass | ✅ User interface interactions |
| Requisition Management | ❌ HTTP 500 | 🔥 **CRITICAL** - Full UI testing |
| Procurement Management | ✅ Pass | ✅ Approval workflow validation |
| Inventory Management | ✅ Pass | ✅ Search and filter UI testing |
| Supplier Management | ✅ Pass | ✅ Master data UI validation |
